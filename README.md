![screeshot](http://i.imgur.com/2uqR3Tg.png)

Itâ€™s  alpha... but it works. 
Please contribute and/or file bugs. 

**Caution:** This add-on will require some configuration before it autocompletes what you want it to autocomplete. Originally, this was written to autocomplete hashtags, you may want to to autocomplete from all words of the document, or a list of predefined keywords etc. see the value `autocomp.config` in the  `ep_autocomp/static/js/autocomp.js` file
for customizing simple cases and the value `autocomp.getPossibleSuggestions` for more complex customizations.
