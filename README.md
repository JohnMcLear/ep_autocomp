# Autocompletion for Etherpad

![screeshot](http://i.imgur.com/2uqR3Tg.png)

Itâ€™s  alpha-ish, but works. 
Please contribute and/or file bugs. 

## Customization
In its preconfigured form it completes words (searches the document for words, suggests existing words if you type them again). This add-on will require configuration if you want it to autocomplete anything else. 

See the value `autocomp.config` in the  `ep_autocomp/static/js/autocomp.js` file
for customizing simple cases and the value `autocomp.getPossibleSuggestions` for more complex customizations.

Originally, this was written to autocomplete hashtags, you may want to complet from list of predefined keywords or from a hash of usernames after typing an *@* etc. There are some examples in the sourcecode. 

## Install
Open terminal, navigate  to your etherpad folder and: type `npm install ep_autocomp` OR type `git clone https://github.com/jdittrich/ep_autocomp.git node_modules/ep_autocomp`
